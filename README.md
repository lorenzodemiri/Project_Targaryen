## Syncing :checkered_flag:

1) Before starting the work of the day you have to sync with the last version of the MAIN BRANCH

2) git pull origin main   

3) git checkout "*YOURBRANCHNAME*"

4) git fetch

5) git merge main

6) git checkout "*YOURBRANCHNAME*"

7) git commit -m "*Date of today*"

8) git push origin "*YOURBRANCHNAME*"

## Guide To Collaborate :hammer:

1) git clone https://github.com/lorenzodemiri/Project_Targaryen.git

2) open folder **Project_Snape** (cd Project_Snape)

3) now you have to create a new branch called by your name ( git checkout -b "*YOURNAME*" )

4) Add your work to the project or modify the file that you want

5) Then Stage your work (git add .) for staging all the file at the same time or ( git add "*nameoffile*")

6) Commit your work (git commit -m "*Write here what have you done*")

7) Now push your branch ( git push origing "*YOURNAME*" ) (***NB DONT push to MAIN branch***)

8) When you think that your work should be merged on the main branch: 

9) Go to your github page where is the repo and you should see you branch and a button 
   *COMPARE AND PULL REQUEST*
   
10) This will take you to the *OPEN A PULL REQUEST*

10) On the left side you should be able to see the button *REVIEWER*
	(If you are a collaborator you can merge your own pull request, but it makes more sense to have a "Master Merger"
	 review and accepts the pull request)
	
11) Select *LORENZO DEMIRI*

12) Wait for my review and after that you can click on "*MERGE PULL REQUEST*"

***NB: DONT PUSH TO ORIGIN MAIN BUT ALWAYS PUSH ON YOUR BRANCH AND AFTER THAT CREATE A PULL REQUEST***
## Guide How to Ignore the csv files:hammer:

1) Be sure that you are working on your branch 

2) Find and Select the file that you don't want to push

3) If you are from terminal just type ( git check-ignore -v *PATH FILE* ) if you are on github desktop follow this easy and short [guide](https://caltechlibrary.github.io/git-desktop/05-ignore)
